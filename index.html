        1. <a href="https://dev.weshare.net">Weshare </a> - educational website
        for Israeli students (the link is not available anymore) Educational
        website, the analog of "Udemy". There is a possibility of group or
        individual classes. Registration via email invitations. Different types
        of classes with different instructors. I wrote complex schedule logic
        with the validation of all occupied dates and times. Lots of pages on
        creating a lesson and registering for it.

        2. <a href="https://www.lab.one">Lab1 </a> - automatically captures user
        interaction meta-data (such as computer usage, meetings, phone calls,
        TNA) and translates it to valuable information about tasks, people, and
        time. I upgraded all the libraries on the site, the implementation of
        graphic template, dealt with all its functionality (pagination,
        sorting), and completely redid all the modal windows and the logic of
        adding and editing on all pages of the site.

        3. <a href="https://deflamel.com">Deflamel </a> - The point of the
        project is to generate a picture by keywords. My task was to collect
        description data from several pages and send it to the server. After
        that, I got a set of pictures, fonts, and colors and combined them, and
        gave examples to the user in poor quality. If the user didn't like it he
        could load more. To download the images in their normal resolution, the
        user had to be subscribed. Also, there was an image editor. There was a
        breast of images in the background. I connected Stripe and PayPal.

        4. <a href="https://www.quickinspect.net">Quickinspect </a> - Inspection
        Business Platform The site manages inspections. Made admin panel, edited
        and created new inspections. Fixed a lot of bugs.
